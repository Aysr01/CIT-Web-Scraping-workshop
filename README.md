Welcome to this notebook, where we will explore the exciting journey of web scraping images from Unsplash and utilizing them to train a Deep Learning (DL) model. Unsplash is a vast repository of high-quality images, making it an ideal source for diverse datasets.

In this notebook, our primary objectives are:

**Data Scraping:** We will leverage web scraping techniques to gather images from Unsplash. Specifically, we'll focus on scraping images from two distinct classes to build a diverse dataset.

**Data Preprocessing:** After obtaining the images, we'll perform essential preprocessing tasks such as resizing, normalizing, and organizing the data to prepare it for model training.

**Deep Learning Model:** We'll design and train a DL model using a popular framework TensorFlow. The model will be tailored to classify images belonging to the two classes we scraped.

**Model Evaluation:** Once the model is trained, we'll assess its performance using evaluation metrics and visualize its predictions on unseen data. By the end of this notebook, you'll have gained hands-on experience in web scraping, data preprocessing, and building and training a DL model for image classification. Let's dive in and unlock the potential of extracting knowledge from the vast visual resources available on Unsplash!
